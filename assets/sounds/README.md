# Custom Notification Sound Setup

## Sound File Location

Place your custom notification sound file here:

- **Path**: `assets/sounds/rest_complete.mp3` or `rest_complete.wav`
- **Format**: MP3 or WAV (recommended: WAV for better compatibility)
- **Duration**: 1-3 seconds recommended
- **Size**: Keep under 100KB for best performance

## Recommended Sound

You can:

1. Use a free sound from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org)
2. Use a notification sound from [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com)
3. Create your own using audio editing software

## Current Setup

The notification service is configured to use:

- **Android**: Custom sound from `assets/sounds/rest_complete.mp3`
- **iOS**: Default system sound (custom sounds require additional configuration)

## Note

If you don't add a custom sound file, the app will fall back to the default system notification sound.
